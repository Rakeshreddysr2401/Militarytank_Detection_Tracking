# Militarytank_Detection_Tracking
An autonomous navigation by a military tank towards its target such as another military tank or vehicles, based on the detection, locking-on and following the movements of the target is a much sought after application. We will simulate the war field using cars. A car mounted with NVidia GPU board and HD camera, shall detect other cars and locks-on to one of the nearest cars and follows it.


## Technologies

- IOT Programming, NVidia GPU Programming, Deep Learning.

## Prerequisites


First before going directly to project we need to know how things work so we need to understand some basic models.

-[Wheat Seeds Dataset](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/).

-[Yolo v3 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640).

-[Yolo v3 code with Darknet](https://github.com/heartkilla/yolo-v3/blob/master/yolo_v3.py).

-[Tracking by DeepSort](https://learnopencv.com/understanding-multiple-object-tracking-using-deepsort/).

**By understanding the above topics and  working on this project we get to Know**

->What is Convolutional Neural Network And how it works.

->What is Yolo,Anchors,labling,Annotating,Darknet,Non_Max_Supression and why we use these things.

->How our algorithms get trained and tested and predicted.
