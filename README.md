# Militarytank_Detection_Tracking
An autonomous navigation by a military tank towards its target such as another military tank or vehicles, based on the detection, locking-on and following the movements of the target is a much sought after application. We will simulate the war field using cars. A car mounted with NVidia GPU board and HD camera, shall detect other cars and locks-on to one of the nearest cars and follows it.
